# project title : SPI Full UVM
The project completion date is october 15, 2023.

The UVM project encompasses the development of two comprehensive UVM environments for the Dual-port RAM and the SPI slave wrapper.
The RTL of the SPI, previously completed (During Eng. Kareem Waseem course), will serve as the Golden Model for this Testbench.
Golden Model and Assertions will serve as checking mechanism.
The task involves identifying and rectifying errors and bugs present in another provided RTL.
Comprehensive coverage metrics, including code coverage, assertion coverage, and functional coverage, have been achieved at 100%.
